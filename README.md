Goals:
- Build a solid understanding of a terminal based work structure.
- Learn the beginnings of standard DevOps practices.
- Build on the standard DevOps knowledge I have gained and improve over the years.

Concerns:
- My knowledge of networking is limited and I may struggle with that.
- I am quick to learn and need to make sure I don't get ahead of myself and miss something simple.

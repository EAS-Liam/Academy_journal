Basic Netwoorking:

What I learned:
- Network configuration happens inside a file on linux based systems.
- Editing a configuration file will allow you to set a static IP and change DNS.
- System will check local host names before searching the internet for the host.
- You can set a hostname for an ip in your local hosts file.

What went well:
- Getting my VMs IP, DNS information was simple enough.
- Setting a hostname for the other trainees machine and pinging it.

What didn't go well:
- Setting the static IP and DNS was not originally saving.

What can I improve:
- I need to look deeper into network configuration to build a better understanding of what can be done and how to do it.

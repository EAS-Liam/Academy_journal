Client Server:

What I learned:
- telnet can be used to connect into systems over the terminal.

What went well:
- Using telnet to connect into an IRC chat was interesting and informative.

What didn't go well:
- Original diagram was very basic and didn't look very good.

What can I improve:
- I could do with gaining a deeper knowledge of networking protocols and how they can link into eachother.

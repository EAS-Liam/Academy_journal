Linux Commands:

What I learned:
- I learned about piping commands into other commands like feeding an ls command into a file.
- I learned how to chain commands one after another.
- I learned how to use script files to execute a list of commands.

What went well:
- Navigation of the terminal was fairly easy with no isses.
- Creating and executing the script file went well.

What didn't go well:
- N/A

What can I improve:
- I could build a deeper knowledge of commands and their flags.

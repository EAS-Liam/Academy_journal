    First Day task was network style escape room.
    Each of us had a vm to log into with a message at start.
    
    First thing was to setup static IP addresses for our vms
vi /etc/resolv.conf
    by edditing the resolv file we could set our static IP

vi /etc/hosts
    we then edited the hosts file to add eachothers IPs with hostnames

    Next we needed to find the app files that were hinted to in the login messages
find / -name app*zip
    the find command was used on Max's system to find the app zip files that would need to be distributed to each vm

    We originally tried to use a scp pull to get the files but were told scp was off limits for this task

    Instead we moved to setting up a http-server with the command:
http-server
    when this servre was running on one vm we had the http server for our network

curl https://max/app3.zip
    curl command was used while http-server was running to request the app3 zip file from max' system

    Next we each had to unzip and modify our app index.js files to ensure they were all running on the same port (80) and each was pointing to the next in the chain.

    Once tha pp link connection was set and each app was running on each machine someone could do a call to app 1 and would get a response from each app down the chain 1-2-3-4-5 until 5 gave out a message.

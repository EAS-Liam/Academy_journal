    This second task was about setting up a connection link out of the closed network we were in. 1 system needed to be the DHCP, 1 needed to be the Gateway and 1 needed to be the DNS. My system was chosen to be the DNS
    
    The first thing to do was to once again set our static IP

nmtui
    We used the nmtui menu to set our IP, Gateway and DNS to be set to the correct addresses

    I was breifly connected to the internet to allow me to download the required bind untilities
dnf install bind bind-untils
    this command was used to download those packages
    I was then disconnected from the internet once again

systemctl enable named
system status named
    These 2 commands were run first to enable the DNS and chek the status of internet
    With this working it was now time to start edditing it

vi /ect/named.conf
    This was the first file edited to remove the localhost connection and add the IP range of our network to the query
    Then at the bottom of the file I needed to create the zone links to the forwardzone and reversezone.

vi /var/named/easlab.co.uk
    This created the forward zone file which was configured to hold the hostnames for each of the team members IP

vi /var/named/10.0.0.db
    This file was created for the reverse zone file

systemctl restart named
systemctl status named
    These 2 commands were used to restart the DNS and check the status of it.
    At this point I was able to ping one of the members with the app hostname goven in the forward zone file
    I was also able to ping google meaning I had a link to the internet through the Gateway too

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/udp
firewall-cmd --reload
    These 2 commands were used to ensure firewall privaliges for the other members and restart it to make the changes take effect

    At this point the DNS was working and each of the systems on the network could ping eachother and ping google

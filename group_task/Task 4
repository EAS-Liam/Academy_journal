    Task 4 is to automate the process of the previous task with bash scripts.

    First thing we did was capture all of the config and setup files that needed to be editied during the process of seting up the different services.
    With the config files captured we needed to make sure we had all the commands that needed to be run for each role.
    With our Academy Journals we had these already captured.

    Next it was onto planning and writing each individual script.
    My main priority was the Master-Script but I was also collaborating to help write up the other scripts too.

    Planning and writing the DHCP script was done by Harrision with assistance from me and using my Academy Journal write up for the commands and their order.
    
    Planning and writing the Master-Script is the main task I have.
    This script will prompt the user for what they want to set the system it is run on to do asking for Gateway, DHCP or DNS.
    It will then take the users input and will pull down the required script from github and execute that script.

    At this stage after the first day the DHCP script has been written by Harrison (some alterations may need to be made) and the Master-Script has the bare bones structure of running bash files and ssh hopping.

    Before proceeding with the rest of the master script we decided to run some tests on the individual scripts.

    Starting out I reset the vms back to their initial snapshot and then had to setup the network adapters for the ingress and egress systems.

    With those set we had vms set back to their initial state ready for our script testing.

    We were able to ssh into Kaines vm and then from there could clone the repo containing our scripts.
    We then ran the command
ssh root@192.168.1.175 < dhcp.conf
    This command will tell the system to run the bash file on the supplied ssh system instead of running it on the local system.
    
    From this point we could see that in general our script seemed to be running well and was correctly creating and populating the config files with the correct data however we ran into the issue that the dnf and yum package managers were down so at this point we were unable to test downloading and running the services.
    This we will now pick up tomorrow when hopefully those paclage managers are back up.

    After coming back the next day the dnf package manager was up and running again so we could start testing our scripts.

ssh root@192.168.1.175 < dhcp.sh
    We first tested the dhcp script and after ironing out a few directory typos such as looking for network-script instead of network-scripts then we were able to confirm that the dhcp.sh script worked exactly as intended.


    We next decided to try testing the gateway scrip. From Kaines machine we tested the gateway script making some minor adjustments where needed to fix any typod and the gateway script seemed to work fine. It setup the iptables and suceeded without errors.
    However, we did then notice then when we tried to test one of the other machines they did not seem to be able to access the internet through the gateway so the gateway has an issue we have not yet detected.
    We have confirmed that the systems are having their gateway set to the 10.0.0.1 ip by the dhcp so that is not the issue.

    We decided to take a break from the gateway script and try to test the dns script instead.

    We ran the dns script on kaines vm and after tourbleshooting some syntax errors which were stopping the server from running we got the server up and running fine.
    The main issue we then run into was the search domain was still defaulting to easlab.co.uk even though the systems were having the domain search easlab.local set by the dhcp.

    The issue turned out to be that because we were testing the DNS on a different system that we will be running it on officially then the dhcp was not pointing everyone to the correct DNS system, after updating the dhcp with the temp change we coudl confirm that the dns was working.

    I then reverted the dhcp back to it's correct value form the temp one set for testing purposes.

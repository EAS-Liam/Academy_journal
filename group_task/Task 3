    The third task is to repeat the second task but this time there are som extra restriction.
    Each person must take on a new task and not the same one they have already done.
    We no longer have access to vcenter and will need to use SSH to connect to the vms throughout this task.
    The other restriction is that only the ingress system (Max) and the egress system (Kaine) have an IP address.
    The frst thing we need to do is find the ingress IP for Max' system so that we can setup DHCP to give the others an IP.

nmap 192.168.1.0/24 -p 22
    We used nmap to scan the network for IP addresses which were open to an SSH connection.
    We discovered the IP 192.168.1.150

ssh user@192.168.1.150
    Using SSH we connected to that IP and confirmed that it was the ingress and gained us access to the first system on the segregated network.

    Once in it was time to setup the dhcp server to distribute the dynamic IPs

dnf install dhcp-server
    This was used to install the dhcp server package

    Once downloaded it was time to edit the configuration
vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
    This command was used to enter the file I would need to configured
    This file was configured with the subnet and netmask and given the desired IP range for the dynamic IP addresses.

systemctl start dhcpd
systemctl status dhcpd
    Once configured the dhcpd server could be started and the status checked.

firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
    Last the firewall needed to be configured to allow the dhcp permission and then restarted.


    With each of the systems given a dynamic IP we had access to our VMs.
    We could use an ssh connection to get into them.
ssh user@10.0.0.10
    This was used to ssh into my vm with the dynamic IP.

    Once I had access I could now set a static IP for this vm.
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-script/ifcfg-ens160
    With this file I could set my IP to static and set it to 10.0.0.3

    After taht was set in the file I needed to update the network setting.
ifdown ens160 && ifup ens160
    I had to use a command chain to be able to shutdown and restart the ens160 network.
    As soon as the ifdown was run the ssh connection would drp and there would be no way to get access to the vm.
    This is why I had to use the command chain to make sure that even after I lost connection the vm would bring the network back up.
    With it back up again I simply had to ssh back into the vm and I now had a static IP.

    Once the gateway was set on 10.0.0.1 we now had access to the internet through that gateway.

dnf install dchp-server
    It was now time to download the dhcp-server packege for with this system.

vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
    It was now time to configure the dhcp server again on this vm.

systemctl start dhcpd
systemctl status dhcpd
    With the configuration set I could run the dhcpd server and check the status to confirm it was running correctly.

firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
    With that done it's time to add the acception to the firewall again and reload it.

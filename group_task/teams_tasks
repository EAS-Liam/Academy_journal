Kalem:
    Doing DHCP
    started off setting static IP using NMTUI, alternative is rsolve.conf
    Updated DNF packege using 
dnf makecash
    Next was 
dnf install dhcp-server
    Next confirgured server config files
    Template from gogole with adjusted values
startsystemctl start dhcp
    That started the dhcp
    Next max run the http-server
    Then we could pull the app files and do those


Max:
    First set static IP with resolv.conf
    Working along side with Liam to help with setting up DNS
    Was going through articles and keeping track of what Liam was Doing
    working as a fact checker of sorts and keeping track of syntax
    After DNS was setup Had to run a http-server to serve the app files to everyone


Harrison:
    Settup static IP
    Working with Ethan to sort out the Gateway
    Had some assistance from Rhys
    Worked with IP-Tables
    IP-Tables used to set what can go through the Gateway
    grabbed app from Max with wget while http-server was running


Things that tripped us up:
    Firewall - The firewalls often reset and we didn't notice so we often found ourselves wondering why we couldn't make connections but the solution was to re disable the firewall.
    Typo in DNS config - I had a missed typo in the DNS config file that took quite a while to spot which meant the forward zone file link was not working correctly.
    ifdown / ifup - When changing network settings we often forgot we would need to run an ifdown and ifup to reset the network card so taht it used the updated settings.
    DHCP typos - A few issues with miss typed urls and adresses in DHCP config causing issues at the beginning.
    App data transfer - App 5 was missing the data transfer at first so would not pass the data from apps 1-2-3-4 onto app 6.

    With the DNS server up and running it was time to get the apps redistributed
    By setting up the http-server we could run:
wget http://10.0.0.5/app3.zip
    This command pulled the app3 zip from Max's system onto mine

    With each of us having our respective apps we needed to make sure all the links between them were correct
    We then needed to adjust app 5 to make sure that it instead of outputing the data it linked to app6 on Andrews system outside of the segragated network
    Andrew threw us through some loops and we had to add a query to the url to eventually get to the edditing

    With that the Task was now complete
    And what a task it was :)
